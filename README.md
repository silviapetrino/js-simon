Display 5 random numbers on the page. Then, a 5-second timer starts.

After 5 seconds, the numbers disappear, and the user must input, one at a time via prompt(), the numbers they saw previously. 

After all 5 numbers have been entered, the software indicates how many and which of the numbers to guess were correctly identified.

To do list:

  1. Generate a list of five random numbers between 1 and 50.

  2.  Display the list on the page.

  3.  Ask the user to input five numbers and store them in an array.

  4.  Create a function to clear the page.

  5.  Create a function to compare the two arrays and use includes method to check for the presence of numbers and count them. Insert the found numbers into a new list.

  6.  Compare the two arrays.
